## Make a Suggestion, Relay an Insight, Complain, Open an Issue

Anything you want to say is welcome - as long as you are considerate of other people and express yourself with dignity.

Please try and use one of the [issue templates](https://github.com/doowat/doowat.github.io/issues/new/choose) - Issues help me keep track of tasks, allow an open discussion, and allow me to provide updates.

## Contribute an activity, Contribute code, Open a pull request

### Add an Activity
Activities are stored in a [plain text file](https://github.com/doowat/doowat.github.io/blob/master/src/activities/) - one activity per line. Adding an activity is as simple as adding a line.

Activities are targeted at moments outside the house - when you don't necessarily have any toys or materials on you. The activities require no preparations and can be accomplished in a short time.

### Suggest Code Addition or Change
I try to keep it simple, but I really have no special style guides or rules. If it works, if it makes sense, if it benefits the project - I'm happy to include any contribution. Fork me!
