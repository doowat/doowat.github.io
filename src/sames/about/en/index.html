				Doing things with kids can take longer: Popping out to pick up milk; walking to the local park; waiting for the bus (okay it takes the same amount of time but it could be more frustrating). Make use of this time, it's precious.

				Don't waste your days having dull moments &mdash; Make every moment fun! Here are some fun things to do while you're at it. Draw a <a id="draw" href="/en/">random, easy activity</a>. Save your favourites.
